# crontabR

Schedule cronjobs from R

I have a lot of recurring reports and data processing that I need on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. crontabR is a package that 
makes it easy to schedule tasks in R with crontab. You can access the functionality through a new RStudio addin as well. 

Still experimental and not well documented.
